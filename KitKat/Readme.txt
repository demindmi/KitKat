Hello :D

Privet! - I will use english here as it makes more sense.

This folder (Kitkat) is an example of a simple website structure. 
Usually it will get more complex, but this is good enough to show how things work.

Here you should see 4 folder and 2 files.
=Folders
==CSS - this will have all your styling files, those have .css extension (CSS = Cascading Style Sheets)
==Media - this will have all your images, videos and other files
==Pages - this will have all your webiste pages(excpet for main one) pages have .html extension (HTML = HyperText Markup Language)
==Scripts - this is where all your 'logic' will live, files will have .js extension and belomg to JavaScript type

=Files
==Readme - hi, you are in it!
==index.html - your main (home) page. It is always named index and always will use .html format

The basics are as follows:
HTML are files that will describe where you want everything on your page - text, images, buttons, everything
CSS are files that will allow you to modife any visual part of the page - colors, sizes, widths, and much more 
JS are JavaScript files, JS is the main programming language of the web.

Note: this is a very simple site and we will not use any libraries, so some of the things will look redundant or odd, with more libraries 
developed we can write simple and cleaner code. But thats later, for now the basics.

Plan: Simply open index.html in your browser. Play around, click the buttons and see what happens. Once you are done playing around,
open visual studio code (free https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and open this folder in there. This will allow you to see the
entire project easily. Now you can mopdify any file in the project (dont be scared) and simply save the file and refresh the browser to 
see the changes.

Have fun :) 

p.s this is NOT a responsive site, which means it might look bad on small screens.
